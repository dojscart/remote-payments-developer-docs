>Google Pay provides a fast, simple and secure way to pay using the cards saved on Google accounts.

## How it works


**Supported Card Networks:**

* Discover
* Mastercard
* Visa

If you already add [Apple Pay](/payment-methods/apple-pay), Google Pay will work automatically. (???)

## Try it out

You can find a complete example of the Google Pay code in [GitHub](link).

## Testing Google Pay

The Google Pay [Test Card Suite](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/resources/test-card-suite) allows you to test Google Pay without the need of adding real cards to Google accounts.

To instantly view these cards in your Google Account TEST environment, join [Google's User Group](https://groups.google.com/g/googlepay-test-mode-stub-data) and all test cards will be automatically added to your account so you do not need to add them manually.

You are free to leave or join [Google's Test Card Suite Group](https://groups.google.com/g/googlepay-test-mode-stub-data) as needed. To leave, select My membership settings and click Leave group.

Developers must use real cards in a PRODUCTION environment.

The test card suite is only intended for use in TEST environments, it will be automatically detected and shown when accessing a TEST environment and hidden when you are accessing a PROCUTION environment.

It means that you can use your real Google account to join the test card suite, but we recommend to use a Google account used to run integration tests.
