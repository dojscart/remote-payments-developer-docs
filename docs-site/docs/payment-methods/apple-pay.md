## How it works


## Try it out

Use of Apple Pay on the Web is subject to the Apple Pay on the Web terms of service.

## Testing Apple Pay

To enable test cards for Apple Pay, you must have an Apple Sandbox Tester Account, then you will be able to add test cards into your Apple Wallet.

See [Apple's Sandbox Testing Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/) to setup your Sandbox Tester Account and check the section Test Cards for Apps and the Web to see the full list of supported test cards by Apple. Although our test payment gateway does not support all of them, so if you want to test successful cases, please use the cards listed in the Test Cards section.

If you are not enrolled into the Apple Developer Program and need a tester account, please contact our [support team](add link) for further instructions.
