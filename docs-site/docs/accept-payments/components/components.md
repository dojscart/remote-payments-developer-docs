>Learn how to use the Dojo Components for your online payments.

Dojo Components are our ready-made JavaScript components that you can add to your website to accept payments. The components have error handling and input validation on the Client-side.
This solution is PCI compliant, you are required to submit [Self-Assessment Questionnaire A](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2_1-SAQ-A.pdf).

If you'd rather do less coding, use [Prebuild Checkout Page](../checkout-page/checkout-page.md).
