>Learn how to email receipts with the Dojo API.

Dojo automatically sends email receipts after a successful payment. This is done by providing an email address when making the API request, using the email address of a Customer object:

```json
"customer": {
    "emailAddress": "client@gmail.com",
    "phoneNumber": "078654321"
}
```

Each payment has a receipt history where you can view in the Dojo App.

## Send additional emails

You can manually send additional receipts to customers, to do this use the endpoint below:

``` POST /payment-intents/{paymentIntentId}/receipt```

In your request, include:

* `emails`â€”the list of email addresses to which the receipt should be sent.

For the full API specification, see the [API reference](/api#operation/Receipt_Create).
