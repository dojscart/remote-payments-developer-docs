>Learn how to reverse a payment with the Dojo API.

Use a reversal if you need to cancel a payment, for example if you mistakenly initiated a payment, or a customer has requested a payment to be canceled. You can reverse the full payment amount only. Reversals can only be actioned on the same calendar day as the original payment.

You can only reverse a payment before it has been [captured](../capture/). Payments that have already been captured have to be [refunded](refund/) instead.

If you want to use the Dojo Merchant app for a reversal, see [Reversing online checkout transactions](https://support.dojo.tech/hc/en-gb/articles/4408826217106-Refunding-and-reversing-online-checkout-transactions#h_01FK1T29A54JCYNZ9ZE4HK3G7T).

## Reverse using the Dojo API

To reverse a payment, use the endpoint below:

``` POST /payment-intents/{paymentIntentId}/reversal ```

In your request, include:

* `paymentIntentId`â€”identifies the payment being reverse.

For the full API specification, see the [API reference](/api#operation/Reversal_Create).

### Request example

The next example below shows how you would reverse the payment intent `pi_pT08VyWG3EC_HQB4NBVliA`.

<Tabs groupId="codeGroup">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl" default>

```bash reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/manage-payments/curl/reversal.sh
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/manage-payments/python/reversal.py
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="C#" label="C#">

```cs reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/manage-payments/cs/reversal.cs
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Response example

If your request is successful, the response will return information about the reversal.

```
{
  "status": "Created",
  "message": "reverse for the order 3443",
  "reversalId": "55873"
}
```

## Reversal status

When you reverse a payment, you get a ReverseResponse object in the response, which includes the status field. The status field can be `Created`, `Successful`, or `Failed`.

| Status | Description |
| ------------- | -----|
| `Created`| Dojo is processing the reversal.|
| `Successful` | Dojo has approved the reversal, reversal are being sent to the customer.|
| `Failed`|  The request failed, the customer doesn't receive a reversal. It can be caused by, for example, bad request parameters.|

## Cancel a reverse

Once created, the reverse can't be canceled. As an option, you can create a new payment intent instead of the one that was reversed.
