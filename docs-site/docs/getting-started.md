>Generate API keys and make a first API call.

## Step 1. Create a developer account

Get started by creating a [free developer account](https://portal.dojo.tech/login).

## Step 2. Generate your API keys

To submit payments, you'll be making API requests that are authenticated with an API key. To generate your API keys, go to **Developer portal** --> **API keys** and select **+Create new key**.

Copy and securely store the API key in your systemâ€”you won't be able to restore it later.
If your API key is lost or compromised, you need to ask for a new one.

## Step 3. Make a test API call

To verify that your key is working correctly, let's create a test API call.
Copy the code below, replace the API key with your test API key (with the prefix `sk_sandbox_`), and run the code.

<Tabs groupId="codeGroup">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl" default>

```bash reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/getting-started/curl/create-payment-intent.sh
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/getting-started/python/create-payment-intent.py#L4-L20
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="C#" label="C#">

```csharp reference
https://github.com/dojo-engineering/dojo-samples/blob/main/getting-started/cs/create-payment-intent.cs
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If your account is set up correctly, you receive a response: `200 OK`.

## Step 4. Check the result

After receiving the request, Dojo creates a payment intent and returns its unique id:

```json
{
    "id": "pi_sandbox_RBMHTJ4fIkmSppDILZVCGw",
    ...
}
```

Use this `id` to create a link in the following format:

`https://pay.dojo.tech/checkout/{id}`

Follow the link to see the result.
